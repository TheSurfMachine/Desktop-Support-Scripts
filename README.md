# Desktop-Support-Scripts
A repository of PowerShell, Batch, CMD, VB commonly used in IT Support

## I've uploaded these for other to find and use if needed. 
## Please note some of the scripts may fail due to age, version changes, etc... but you may be able to view, slightly modify the script and get them working. 
## These scripts were not made by myself, but were gathered over time from all over the internet. So, if the scripts list authoers they get the credit, and if ## no authoer is listed, I still am communicating I am not the author and do not know who the authoer is.
## I do not think there are any scripts that are not free and open sourse. To my knowledge none of them are taken, extracted from paid products, etc...
## There you have it. :) Enjoy and make use of them.
